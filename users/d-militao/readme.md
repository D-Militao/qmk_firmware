# D-Militao Userspace

The main purpose of this userspace is to keep my personal keymaps clean by moving shared code in here and also allowing me to easily change all my keymaps at once.

It includes code from *SpacebarRacecar Userspace* that he used to emulate the US layout on the German layout.
I have adapted his code in order to emulate certain aspects of the Portuguese layout on the US layout.

Perhaps in the future I will do the same as his and emulate the US layout on the Portuguese layout.
My main concern is the use of the "`" and the "~".
Two characters I use frequently and in the Portuguese layout I would be required to double tap in order to input them.
